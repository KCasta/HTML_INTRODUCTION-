        Home is A home page is the main web page <br />that a visitor will view
        when they navigate <br />to a website via a search engine, and it may
        also function as a landing page to attract <br />visitors. In some
        cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website
        has<br />
        multiple home pages.
